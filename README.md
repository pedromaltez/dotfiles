Pedro’s dotfiles
================
Most of the ideas found in my configuration files were unashamedly [stolen from
other dotfiles][fork dotfiles], or found in various places around the internet
and organically absorbed and later incorporated into mine.

As far as my operating systems of choice are concerned I prefer to use [Arch
Linux] or Apple’s OS X on my personal machines. As such, these dotfiles are
tailored for use with those two operating systems.
